##  Introduction

This project explores the development of a **lightweight Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for **IoT mesh networks**, designed and implemented using **Raspberry Pi nodes**, **Snort 3**, and an **MQTT-based messaging system**. It was developed as part of the **COIT13236 Capstone Project** at **CQUniversity**.

A **mesh network** is a communication architecture in which each node (device) connects and relays messages to multiple other nodes. This forms a decentralized and resilient structure ideal for IoT deployments such as smart environments, industrial monitoring, and sensor-based automation.

To handle communication efficiently, the system integrates a central **MQTT broker** hosted on one of the Raspberry Pis. This enables lightweight, real-time data exchange between sensor nodes and the base station, even over unreliable wireless links.

However, these IoT mesh networks are vulnerable to cyber threats due to limited resources, open wireless channels, and weak built-in security. In particular, **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks** can flood the network with traffic, causing serious service disruptions.

This project focuses on detecting such **DoS attacks** in real-time using **Snort 3**, a powerful intrusion detection tool configured for low-resource environments. By combining environmental sensors (e.g., temperature, sound) with distributed security monitoring, this prototype demonstrates how **functionality and security can coexist in an IoT mesh**.
