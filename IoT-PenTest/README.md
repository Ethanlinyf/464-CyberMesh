##  Introduction

This project explores the development of a **lightweight Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for **IoT mesh networks**, designed and implemented using **Raspberry Pi nodes**, **Snort 3**, and an **MQTT-based messaging system**. It was developed as part of the **COIT13236 Capstone Project** at **CQUniversity**.

A **mesh network** is a communication architecture in which each node (device) connects and relays messages to multiple other nodes. This forms a decentralized and resilient structure ideal for IoT deployments such as smart environments, industrial monitoring, and sensor-based automation.

To handle communication efficiently, the system integrates a central **MQTT broker** hosted on one of the Raspberry Pis. This enables lightweight, real-time data exchange between sensor nodes and the base station, even over unreliable wireless links.

However, these IoT mesh networks are vulnerable to cyber threats due to limited resources, open wireless channels, and weak built-in security. In particular, **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks** can flood the network with traffic, causing serious service disruptions.

This project focuses on detecting such **DoS attacks** in real-time using **Snort 3**, a powerful intrusion detection tool configured for low-resource environments. By combining environmental sensors (e.g., temperature, sound) with distributed security monitoring, this prototype demonstrates how **functionality and security can coexist in an IoT mesh**.

##  Problem Definition

As IoT networks continue to scale, especially in distributed environments like mesh topologies, they face increasing threats from network-based attacks. These systems often operate with:

- Low processing power
- Limited memory
- Unsecured wireless communication

Due to these constraints, traditional enterprise-grade security tools cannot be deployed effectively on IoT devices. Additionally, mesh networks lack a central point of control, making security enforcement more complex.

From a **business perspective**, any downtime or compromise in a sensor-driven IoT application can lead to:

- Service outages
- Data integrity loss
- Operational and financial risks

From a **technical perspective**, building a real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can:

- Run on constrained devices (like Raspberry Pi)
- Detect threats like **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks
- And operate in a **decentralized mesh environment**

...requires balancing performance, reliability, and security in a limited-resource setting.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing a **lightweight, scalable, and easily replicable IDS** that can run within a typical IoT mesh setup using

##  Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop and test a **resource-efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for IoT mesh networks that can:

- Detect **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks in real-time  
- Run on **low-cost, low-power devices** (e.g., Raspberry Pi)  
- Use **Snort 3** as the detection engine tailored for IoT-scale traffic  
- Integrate **sensor data** (e.g., temperature, sound) for real-world relevance  
- Use a central **MQTT broker** to coordinate communication between nodes    
- Provide a **foundation for future extension** by students or industry users
  

This system aims to combine practical security implementation with real-time sensor monitoring in a decentralized IoT network setup.
