# How to Set Up and Use a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor with Raspberry Pi

This guide walks you through the complete setup and testing of a Keyestudio DHT11 sensor module connected to a Raspberry Pi. It includes hardware setup, wiring instructions, Python configuration, and verification.

---

## Hardware Required

- Raspberry Pi (with Raspberry Pi OS installed)
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor Module
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- 4.7kΩ Resistor

---

## Step 1: Physical Setup

### 1. Identify the DHT11 Sensor Pins

You will see the following pin labels on the module:

- **G** = Ground  
- **V** = Voltage (Power)  
- **S** = Signal (Data)

### 2. Connect the Wires

| DHT11 Pin | Wire Color | Connects To GPIO | Pi Pin Function |
|-----------|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| G         | Yellow     | GND              | Pin 6 (Ground) |
| V         | Green      | 3.3V or 5V       | Pin 1 (3.3V) or Pin 2 (5V) |
| S         | Blue       | GPIO17           | Pin 11 (GPIO17) |

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries

### 1. Update Package List

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### 2. Install Required Tools

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv libgpiod2 -y
```

### 3. Install the DHT Library (CircuitPython)

```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages adafruit-circuitpython-dht
```

---

## Step 3: Python Script to Read Data

### 1. Create Python Script

```bash
nano dht11_test.py
```

### 2. Paste the Following Code

```python
import time
import board
import adafruit_dht

dht_device = adafruit_dht.DHT11(board.D17)

while True:
    try:
        temp_c = dht_device.temperature
        humidity = dht_device.humidity
        print(f"Temp: {temp_c:.1f}°C  |  Humidity: {humidity:.1f}%")
    except RuntimeError as error:
        print("Reading error:", error.args[0])
    time.sleep(2)
```

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
python3 dht11_test.py
```

---

## Step 4: Output

You should see something like this:

```
Temp: 24.0°C  |  Humidity: 55.0%
```
